            The Washington State University Metro Center is working with the
            Washington Hospitality Association to develop and track key industry
            benchmarks (eight) to help gauge the health of the industry, support
            businesses in making sound decisions, and support policy development
            based on unbiased data. The Metro Center receives three types of
            highly confidential industry data from Washington State’s Employment
            Security Department (ESD) and Department of Revenue (DOR). These
            data are at the individual employer and employee level, numbering
            over 5 million records per quarter and the Metro Center is tracking
            these data from 2010 forward.
